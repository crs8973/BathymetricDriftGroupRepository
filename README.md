# Low-cost, Open-source Bathymetric Mapping Using a Drift Sensor
## Authors: Autumn, Grant, Teryn, and Camille

This GitHub repository provides updated designs for a low-cost, open-source, bathymetric drift sensor. The initial design is hosted in this repository: https://github.com/SUPScientist/smart-coasts-bathy-mapping

We aim to further develop and validate a low-cost bathymetric drift sensor to collect reliable and reproducible depth data in shallow and difficult-to-reach waterways, along with reducing extraneous noise in the data. We attempt to address the need for more accessible bathymetric mapping tools, particularly for public and small-scale research initiatives while reducing costs associated with traditional methods. 

Please read the following for a high-level overview of the project and the contents of this repository.

## Introduction to the Sensor

## Sensor Components and Specifications

## Problems

### Material
Three main folders contain the material for this project: Data Analysis, Firmware, and Wiring.

#### Data Analysis


Low-cost, open-source bathymetric mapping (depth, GPS, angle, datalogging)

This is the repository for the group working on the drifter with GPS, cellular, and bathymetric sensing. We are using a Boron sensor.

Include a well organized readme in the repo's highest level folder such that when someone navigates to the repo, they immediately see a nicely rendered readme file. 

The readme should describe what content the repo intends to provide, what problems it aims to solve, and what material can be found within (and where).
