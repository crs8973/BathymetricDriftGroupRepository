# Low-cost, Open-source Bathymetric Mapping Using a Drift Sensor
## Authors: Autumn, Grant, Teryn, and Camille

This GitHub repository provides updated designs for a low-cost, open-source, bathymetric drift sensor. The initial design is hosted in this repository: https://github.com/SUPScientist/smart-coasts-bathy-mapping

We aim to further develop and validate a low-cost bathymetric drift sensor to collect reliable and reproducible depth data in shallow and difficult-to-reach waterways, along with reducing extraneous noise in the data. We attempt to address the need for more accessible bathymetric mapping tools, particularly for public and small-scale research initiatives while reducing costs associated with traditional methods. 

Please read the following for a high-level overview of the project and the contents of this repository.

## Introduction to the Bathymetric Sensor

While traditional seafloor mapping technology is extremely useful, bathymetric mapping is traditionally limited to scientists that have enough time, resources, and money to carry out mapping expeditions, meaning it is difficult to encourage public involvement in this field (Wölfl et al., 2019). Another limitation is the need for a boat and qualified personnel to transport and run the mapping instruments (Dierssen & Theberge, 2014). In areas that are inaccessible by boat, it is difficult to collect reliable bathymetric data through this methodology (Dierssen & Theberge, 2014; Wölfl et al., 2019). 

A possible solution to these limitations is the use of bathymetric drift sensors (Cocker et al., 2022). Low coast bathymetric drift sensors have several benefits, including accessibility for public research and increased public involvement, ability to map in shallow water, lower cost and time investments, and environmental benefits such as minimizing disturbances to fragile ecosystems.

## Sensor Components and Specifications

### Repository Contents
Three main folders contain the material for this project: Data Analysis, Firmware, and Wiring.

#### Data Analysis

#### Firmware

#### Wiring

Include a well organized readme in the repo's highest level folder such that when someone navigates to the repo, they immediately see a nicely rendered readme file. 

The readme should describe what content the repo intends to provide, what problems it aims to solve, and what material can be found within (and where).
