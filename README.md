Low-cost, open-source bathymetric mapping (depth, GPS, angle, datalogging)

This is the repository for the group working on the drifter with GPS, cellular, and bathymetric sensing. We are using a Boron sensor.

Include a well organized readme in the repo's highest level folder such that when someone navigates to the repo, they immediately see a nicely rendered readme file. 

The readme should describe what content the repo intends to provide, what problems it aims to solve, and what material can be found within (and where).
